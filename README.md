Progress Bar Component

This project contains a simple and reusable Progress Bar component built using React.
I created it as part of my frontend interview preparation, focusing on practicing component structure, props handling, styling, and clean code patterns.

The goal of this mini–project was to improve my understanding of building independent, customizable UI components that can be reused across different applications.

Feel free to explore, modify, or use it as a reference!
